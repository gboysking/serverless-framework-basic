AWS Cognito + Express + Serverless Framework

This project is an implementation of the AWS Cognito service using Express and the Serverless Framework, written in TypeScript. It is based on the implementation described in [this blog post](https://tobelinuxer.tistory.com/60).

The project includes several functions that demonstrate how to integrate Cognito authentication and authorization into a serverless application built using Express and the Serverless Framework. The functions cover basic user registration, login, and access control using JWT tokens.
